Will Labour lose most of their seat in Scotland?,1,"""Salmond has repeatedly attacked Labour for ""getting into bed with the Tories"" in their pro-UK coalition, focusing on significant levels of anger and resentment among Labour voters over austerity policies.Those attacks are in part behind the sharp surge in support for independence among Labour voters, which has forced a panicked the UK Labour leader, Ed Miliband, to return to Scotland on Wednesday to mount an emergency effort to stem the flow of Labour votes towards yes.Salmond ran a minority government from 2007 to 2011, but relied heavily on the Tories to pass all four of his annual budgets – including his budget in the first year of the Tory-led government at Westminster in 2011, with total spending over that time worth about £120bn.In return for that support, he agreed with the Tories to introduce some of the most popular policies of his first term, helping him to a landslide victory in the 2011 Scottish elections.The Tories enjoyed the deal because it helped them prove their support for the devolved parliament, after their popularity was heavily hit by their vigorous opposition to devolution until 1997.The SNP is also in coalition with the Tories in at least one Scottish council, South Ayrshire, and has been in multi-party coalitions with the Conservatives and other parties several times since taking power in 2007.The unofficial coalition with Goldie's party in the Scottish parliament allowed the SNP, which then had only one seat more than Labour, to outvote Labour and the Lib Dems; after the Scottish Green party provoked a brief crisis by refusing to endorse one budget package, only the Tories kept Salmond's budget package afloat."
