Example Models
==============

Yu et al., 1412 - mean embeddings, projection matrix and dot-product
distance measure:

  * **anssel_yu1412.py** shows the yu1412 classifier applied to its original
    "answer sentence selection" task

  * **sts_yu1412.py** shows a simple embedding-based classifier hacked
    together on a few lines that wouldn't end up dead last in STS2015
    competition
