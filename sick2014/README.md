This dataset is different from the STS dataset in that it aims to capture
only similarities on purely language and common knowledgde level, without
relying on domain knowledge.  There are no named entities or multi-word
idioms, and the models should know that "a couple is formed by a bride
and a groom" but not that "the current president of the US is Barack Obama".
