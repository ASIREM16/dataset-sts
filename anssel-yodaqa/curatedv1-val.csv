What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"In most vertebrates and some molluscs, the eye works by allowing light to enter and project onto a light-sensitive panel of cells, known as the retina, at the rear of the eye."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,1,"Such eyes are typically roughly spherical, filled with a transparent gel-like substance called the vitreous humour, with a focusing lens and often an iris; the relaxing or tightening of the muscles around the iris change the size of the pupil, thereby regulating the amount of light that enters the eye, and reducing aberrations when there is enough light."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,1,"The eyes of most cephalopods, fish, amphibians and snakes have fixed lens shapes, and focusing vision is achieved by telescoping the lens—similar to how a camera focuses."

What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,The common origin (monophyly) of all animal eyes is now widely accepted as fact.
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"This is based upon the shared genetic features of all eyes; that is, all modern eyes, varied as they are, have their origins in a proto-eye believed to have evolved some 540 million years ago, and the PAX6 gene is considered a key factor in this."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"The majority of the advancements in early eyes are believed to have taken only a few million years to develop, since the first predator to gain true imaging would have touched off an ""arms race"" among all species that did not flee the photopic environment."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"Hence multiple eye types and subtypes developed in parallel (except those of groups, such as the vertebrates, that were only forced into the photopic environment at a late stage)."

What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,1,"Phenotypic convergence of the geometry of cephalopod and most vertebrate eyes creates the impression that the vertebrate eye evolved from an imaging cephalopod eye, but this is not the case, as the reversed roles of their respective ciliary and rhabdomeric opsin classes and different lens crystallins show."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"The very earliest ""eyes"", called eyespots, were simple patches of photoreceptor protein in unicellular animals."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"However, the ancestors of modern hagfish, thought to be the protovertebrate were evidently pushed to very deep, dark waters, where they were less vulnerable to sighted predators, and where it is advantageous to have a convex eye-spot, which gathers more light than a flat or concave one."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,This would have led to a somewhat different evolutionary trajectory for the vertebrate eye than for other animal eyes.
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"The thin overgrowth of transparent cells over the eye's aperture, originally formed to prevent damage to the eyespot, allowed the segregated contents of the eye chamber to specialise into a transparent humour that optimised colour filtering, blocked harmful radiation, improved the eye's refractive index, and allowed functionality outside of water."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"Formation of a nontransparent ring allowed more blood vessels, more circulation, and larger eye sizes."

What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"Pit vipers have developed pits that function as eyes by sensing thermal infra-red radiation, in addition to their optical wavelength eyes like those of other vertebrates."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,1,"The resolution of pit eyes can be greatly improved by incorporating a material with a higher refractive index to form a lens, which may greatly reduce the blur radius encountered—hence increasing the resolution obtainable."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,1,"Heterogeneous eyes have evolved at least nine times: four or more times in gastropods, once in the copepods, once in the annelids, once in the cephalopods, and once in the chitons, which have aragonite lenses."

What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"Ocelli (pit-type eyes of arthropods) blur the image across the whole retina, and are consequently excellent at responding to rapid changes in light intensity across the whole visual field; this fast response is further accelerated by the large nerve bundles which rush the information to the brain."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,1,"Another copepod, ""Copilia"", has two lenses in each eye, arranged like those in a telescope."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"In the eyes of most mammals, birds, reptiles, and most other terrestrial vertebrates (along with spiders and some insect larvae) the vitreous fluid has a higher refractive index than the air."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,1,"Thus, animals that have evolved with a wide field-of-view often have eyes that make use of an inhomogeneous lens."

What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,1,"Each of the two eyes of a spookfish collects light from both above and below; the light coming from above is focused by a lens, while that coming from below, by a curved mirror composed of many layers of small reflective plates made of guanine crystals."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"A compound eye may consist of thousands of individual photoreceptor units or ommatidia (ommatidium, singular)."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"The image perceived is a combination of inputs from the numerous ommatidia (individual ""eye units""), which are located on a convex surface, thus pointing in slightly different directions."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"Compared with simple eyes, compound eyes possess a very large view angle, and can detect fast movement and, in some cases, the polarisation of light."

What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"In deep water organisms, it may not be the centre of the eye that is enlarged."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"Their eyes are almost divided into two, with the upper region thought to be involved in detecting the silhouettes of potential prey—or predators—against the faint light of the sky above."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"Accordingly, deeper water hyperiids, where the light against which the silhouettes must be compared is dimmer, have larger ""upper-eyes"", and may lose the lower portion of their eyes altogether."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,Depth perception can be enhanced by having eyes which are enlarged in one direction; distorting the eye slightly allows the distance to the object to be estimated with a high degree of accuracy.
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"On the other hand, the eyes of organisms which operate in low light levels, such as around dawn and dusk or in deep water, tend to be larger to increase the amount of light that can be captured."

What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"Eyes can be the most visible parts of organisms, and this can act as a pressure on organisms to have more transparent eyes at the cost of function."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"Eyes may be mounted on stalks to provide better all-round vision, by lifting them above an organism's carapace; this also allows them to track predators or prey without moving the head."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"It is often measured in ""cycles per degree"" (CPD), which measures an angular resolution, or how much an eye can differentiate one object from another in terms of visual angles."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"For example, if each pattern is 1.75 cm wide and is placed at 1 m distance from the eye, it will subtend an angle of 1 degree, so the number of white/black bar pairs on the pattern will be a measure of the cycles per degree of that pattern."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"The highest such number that the eye can resolve as stripes, or distinguish from a grey block, is then the measurement of visual acuity of the eye."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"For a human eye with excellent acuity, the maximum theoretical resolution is 50 CPD (1.2 arcminute per line pair, or a 0.35 mm line pair, at 1 m)."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"A horse has higher acuity through most of the visual field of its eyes than a human has, but does not match the high acuity of the human eye's central fovea region."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"However, in the compound eye, the resolution is related to the size of individual ommatidia and the distance between neighbouring ommatidia."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,1,Physically these cannot be reduced in size to achieve the acuity seen with single lensed eyes as in mammals.
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,Compound eyes have a much lower acuity than mammalian eyes.
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"The pigment molecules used in the eye are various, but can be used to define the evolutionary distance between different groups, and can also be an aid in determining which are closely related – although problems of convergence do exist."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"The eyes of vertebrates usually contain cilliary cells with c-opsins, and (bilaterian) invertebrates have rhabdomeric cells in the eye with r-opsins."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"However, some ""ganglion"" cells of vertebrates express r-opsins, suggesting that their ancestors used this pigment in vision, and that remnants survive in the eyes."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"They may have been expressed in ciliary cells of larval eyes, which were subsequently resorbed into the brain on metamorphosis to the adult form."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"C-opsins are also found in some derived bilaterian-invertebrate eyes, such as the pallial eyes of the bivalve molluscs; however, the lateral eyes (which were presumably the ancestral type for this group, if eyes evolved once there) always use r-opsins."

What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"In general, Lewis attempts to keep poetry within the reach of the common person, while Tillyard thinks of the poet as a person who is ""a cut above the common person."""
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"As an example of what poetry is about, Lewis cites a poem, part of William Wordsworth’s ""Prelude""."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"Another thing that Tillyard begins to do in this chapter is to suggest that the poet is a cut above the average person, for example, by writing about “the superior penetration of poetic genius” (38); later he will call Wordsworth “a superior person” (68) and Milton one “who is truly virtuous.”"
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"Lewis offers three dilemmas, or three ways of offending against personality: (1) first, that encounter with a real personality forces us out of the world of poetry, (2) second, that it is uncivil to ignore what a person says and think instead of the person, and (3) third, that poetry is in danger of becoming Poetolatry, that is, the worship of poetry."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"Part of Lewis’s second dilemma is that in social life, it is not civil to think about the person who addresses us in conversation instead of thinking about what he says."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"I would agree, since ad hominem arguments are often the typical response to the person whose position we cannot refute."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"“It is a serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses, to remember that the dullest and most uninteresting person you talk to may one day be a creature which, if you saw it now, you would be strongly tempted to worship, or else a horror and a corruption.”"
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"Early in this chapter, Tillyard agrees with Lewis that ""Poetry... must give the green to the tree and not to our eyes"" (60), and he concedes Lewis’s position as a possible one (60), i.e. that in Robert Herrick’s poem about Julia the issue is Julia herself, not the fact of the poet’s awakening towards Julia."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,He then argues that the little things count for much in a person's mental pattern.
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,Each one sees his own position better than the other person’s position and that the two of them are not that far apart.
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"In the last chapter, Tillyard says ""that personality accounts for only a part"" (115) of poetry."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"He probably meant ""a small part."""
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"Tillyard also agrees with Lewis that at times the little things matter a great deal for what they say about the writer’s personality, but only if those little things are part of the essence of the individual’s personality."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"Lewis champions the common person, the ordinary person who is really not ordinary."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"This point continues the debate over poetry and poets, i.e. whether the poet is a cut above or not."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"We share the poet’s consciousness and look with his eyes, not in reciprocity (as in mutual love when the lovers look at each other) but in sympathy or ""feeling together"" (when the poet and the reader of poetry both look at the same thing)."
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,But not all Romantics put poets into a class part.
What part of the eye continues to grow throughout a person's life?,0,"So, in a sense, Tillyard agrees with Lewis’s plea for the Common Reader and for poetry to be seen as something that anyone can appreciate, although he still thinks the poet a higher person than the rest."

How old was George Washington when he died?,0,"In such models it is found that each electron in helium partly screens the nucleus from the other, so that the effective nuclear charge ""Z"" which each electron sees, is about 1.69 units, not the 2 charges of a classic ""bare"" helium nucleus."
How old was George Washington when he died?,0,The nucleus of the helium-4 atom is identical with an alpha particle.
How old was George Washington when he died?,0,"High-energy electron-scattering experiments show its charge to decrease exponentially from a maximum at a central point, exactly as does the charge density of helium's own electron cloud."
How old was George Washington when he died?,0,"This symmetry reflects similar underlying physics: the pair of neutrons and the pair of protons in helium's nucleus obey the same quantum mechanical rules as do helium's pair of electrons (although the nuclear particles are subject to a different nuclear binding potential), so that all these fermions fully occupy 1s orbitals in pairs, none of them possessing orbital angular momentum, and each cancelling the other's intrinsic spin."

How old was George Washington when he died?,0,"For example, the stability and low energy of the electron cloud state in helium accounts for the element's chemical inertness, and also the lack of interaction of helium atoms with each other, producing the lowest melting and boiling points of all the elements."
How old was George Washington when he died?,0,"In a similar way, the particular energetic stability of the helium-4 nucleus, produced by similar effects, accounts for the ease of helium-4 production in atomic reactions involving both heavy-particle emission, and fusion."

How old was George Washington when he died?,0,"The unusual stability of the helium-4 nucleus is also important cosmologically: it explains the fact that in the first few minutes after the Big Bang, as the ""soup"" of free protons and neutrons which had initially been created in about 6:1 ratio cooled to the point that nuclear binding was possible, almost all first compound atomic nuclei to form were helium-4 nuclei."
How old was George Washington when he died?,0,"So tight was helium-4 binding that helium-4 production consumed nearly all of the free neutrons in a few minutes, before they could beta-decay, and also leaving few to form heavier atoms such as lithium, beryllium, or boron."
How old was George Washington when he died?,0,"Helium-4 nuclear binding per nucleon is stronger than in any of these elements (see nucleogenesis and binding energy) and thus no energetic drive was available, once helium had been formed, to make elements 3, 4 and 5."

How big is the planet Venus?,0,The terraforming of Venus is the theoretical process of engineering the global environment of the planet Venus in such a way as to make it suitable for human habitation.
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"Terraforming Venus was first seriously proposed by the astronomer Carl Sagan in 1961 although fictional treatments, such as The Big Rain by Poul Anderson, preceded it."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,The minimum adjustments to the existing environment of Venus to support human life would require three major changes to the planet.
How big is the planet Venus?,0,Terraforming Venus would probably involve reducing the insolation at Venus's surface to prevent the planet from heating up again.
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"Solar shades could be used to reduce the total insolation received by Venus, cooling the planet somewhat."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"A shade placed in the Sun–Venus Lagrangian point also serves to block the solar wind, removing the radiation exposure problem on Venus."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,The size of the shade would be four times the diameter of Venus itself if at the point.
How big is the planet Venus?,0,This size would necessitate construction in space.
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"There would also be the difficulty of balancing a thin-film shade perpendicular to the Sun's rays at the Sun–Venus Lagrangian point with the incoming radiation pressure, which would tend to turn the shade into a huge solar sail."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"One suggested method is to use polar orbiting, solar-synchronous mirrors that reflect light toward the back of the sunshade, from the non-sunward side of Venus."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,Paul Birch proposed a slatted system of mirrors near the point between Venus and the Sun.
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"Each successive row of panels would be +/- 1 degree off the 30-degree deflection angle, causing the reflected light to be skewed 4 degrees from striking Venus."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,The vast sizes require a quantity of material that is many orders of magnitude greater than any human-made object that has ever been brought into space or constructed in space.
How big is the planet Venus?,0,The number and/or size of the balloons would necessarily be great.
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"According to Birch's analysis such colonies and materials would provide an immediate economic return from colonizing Venus, funding further terraforming efforts."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"The amount would be large and would have to be put in place after the atmosphere had been modified already, because Venus's surface is currently completely shrouded by clouds."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"A disadvantage is that Venus already has highly reflective clouds (giving it an albedo of 0.65), so any approach would have to significantly surpass this to make a difference."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"Although this method is still commonly proposed in discussions of Venus terraforming, later discoveries showed it would not be successful."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"The production of organic molecules from carbon dioxide requires an input of hydrogen, which on Earth is taken from its abundant supply of water but which is nearly nonexistent on Venus."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"Because Venus lacks a magnetic field, the upper atmosphere is exposed to direct erosion by solar wind and has lost most of its original hydrogen to space."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,Venus would not begin to cool down until after most of the carbon dioxide has already been removed.
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"Twenty-three years later, in ""Pale Blue Dot"", Sagan conceded that his original proposal for terraforming would not work because the atmosphere of Venus is far denser than was known in 1961."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"For example, their reflectivity could alter the overall albedo of Venus."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"However, it would take an enormous number of such colonies, and large quantities of introduced hydrogen, to have a significant atmospheric impact, because there is over 1.2 kg of carbon in Venus's atmosphere."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"According to Birch, bombarding Venus with hydrogen and reacting it with carbon dioxide, could produce elemental carbon (graphite) and water by the Bosch reaction."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,Bombardment of Venus with refined magnesium and calcium could sequester carbon dioxide in the form of calcium and magnesium carbonates.
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"Modelling by Mark Bullock of Venus's atmospheric evolution suggests that existing surface minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium oxides, could serve as a sink of carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"Birch's proposal involves using a solar shade to cool Venus down sufficiently to permit liquefaction, from a temperature less than 304.18 K and partial pressures of CO2 down to 73.8 bar (carbon dioxide's critical point) and then down to 5.185 bar and 216.85 K (carbon dioxide's triple point)."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,Birch suggests disrupting an icy moon of Saturn and bombarding Venus with its fragments to provide perhaps an average depth of 100 meters of water over the whole planet.
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"The removal of Venus's atmosphere could be attempted by a variety of methods, possibly in combination."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,Directly lifting atmospheric gas from Venus into space would probably prove difficult.
How big is the planet Venus?,0,Venus has sufficiently high escape velocity to make blasting it away with asteroid impacts impractical.
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"Pollack and Sagan calculated in 1994 that an impactor of 700 km diameter striking Venus at greater than 20 km/s, would eject all the atmosphere above the horizon as seen from the point of impact, but because this is less than a thousandth of the total atmosphere and there would be diminishing returns as the atmosphere's density decreases, a very great number of such giant impactors would be required."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"Most of the ejected atmosphere would go into solar orbit near Venus, and, without further intervention, could be captured by Venus's gravitational field and become part of the atmosphere once again."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,Venus's extremely slow rotation means that space elevators would be very difficult to construct because the planet's geostationary orbit lies an impractical distance above the surface; and the very thick atmosphere to be removed makes mass drivers useless for removing payloads from the planet's surface.
How big is the planet Venus?,0,Venus rotates once every 243 days – by far the slowest rotation period of any of the major planets.
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"However, the length of a solar day on Venus is significantly shorter than the sidereal day; to an observer on the surface of Venus the time from one sunrise to the next would be 116.75 days."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"Nevertheless, Venus's extremely slow rotation rate would result in extremely long days and nights, which could prove difficult for most known Earth species of plants and animals to adapt to."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,One proposal to compensate for the rotation rate is a system of orbiting solar mirrors which might be used to provide sunlight to the night side of Venus and possibly shade to the day side surface.
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"In addition to his suggestion of slatted system of mirrors near the point between Venus and the Sun, Paul Birch has proposed a rotating soletta mirror in a polar orbit, which would produce a 24-hour light cycle."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"Increasing the speed of Venus's rotation would require energy many orders of magnitude greater than the construction of orbiting solar mirrors, or even than the removal of Venus's atmosphere."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"G. David Nordley has suggested, in fiction, that Venus might be spun-up to a day-length of 30 Earth days by exporting the atmosphere of Venus into space via mass drivers."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,A proposal by Birch involves the use of dynamic compression members to transfer energy and momentum via high-velocity mass streams to a band around the equator of Venus.
How big is the planet Venus?,0,He calculated that this would give Venus a day of 24 hours in 30 years.
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"Voyage to Venus is a Big Finish Productions audio drama based on the long-running British science fiction television series ""Doctor Who""."

How big is the planet Venus?,0,"Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's ""sister planet"" because of their similar size, mass, proximity to the Sun and bulk composition."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"With a mean surface temperature of 735 K, Venus is by far the hottest planet in the Solar System, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"Venus has no carbon cycle that puts carbon into rock, nor does it seem to have any organic life to absorb carbon in biomass."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"Venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from being seen from space in visible light."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,Venus' surface is a dry desertscape interspersed with slab-like rocks and periodically refreshed by volcanism.
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"Venus is one of the four terrestrial planets in the Solar System, meaning that, like Earth, it is a rocky body."

How big is the planet Venus?,0,"In addition to the impact craters, mountains, and valleys commonly found on rocky planets, Venus has some unique surface features."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"Among these are flat-topped volcanic features called ""farra"", which look somewhat like pancakes and range in size from 20 to 50 km across, and from 100 to 1,000 m high; radial, star-like fracture systems called ""novae""; features with both radial and concentric fractures resembling spider webs, known as ""arachnoids""; and ""coronae"", circular rings of fractures sometimes surrounded by a depression."

How big is the planet Venus?,0,"Venus has several times as many volcanoes as Earth, and it possesses 167 large volcanoes that are over 100 km across."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,The only volcanic complex of this size on Earth is the Big Island of Hawaii.
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"This is not because Venus is more volcanically active than Earth, but because its crust is older."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,Several lines of evidence point to ongoing volcanic activity on Venus.
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"The European Space Agency's ""Venus Express"" recorded abundant lightning in the high atmosphere."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"Although rainfall drives thunderstorms on Earth, there is no rainfall on the surface of Venus (though sulfuric acid rain falls in the upper atmosphere, then evaporates around 25 km above the surface)."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,Almost a thousand impact craters on Venus are evenly distributed across its surface.
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"On Venus, about 85% of the craters are in pristine condition."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"Whereas Earth's crust is in continuous motion, Venus is thought to be unable to sustain such a process."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"Without plate tectonics to dissipate heat from its mantle, Venus instead undergoes a cyclical process in which mantle temperatures rise until they reach a critical level that weakens the crust."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"Without seismic data or knowledge of its moment of inertia, little direct information is available about the internal structure and geochemistry of Venus."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"The similarity in size and density between Venus and Earth suggests they share a similar internal structure: a core, mantle, and crust."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,The slightly smaller size of Venus suggests pressures are significantly lower in its deep interior than Earth.
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"The principal difference between the two planets is the lack of evidence for plate tectonics on Venus, possibly because its crust is too strong to subduct without water to make it less viscous."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"Instead, Venus may lose its internal heat in periodic major resurfacing events."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"Venus has an extremely dense atmosphere, which consists mainly of carbon dioxide and a small amount of nitrogen."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"This makes the Venusian surface hotter than Mercury's, which has a minimum surface temperature of −220 C and maximum surface temperature of 420 C, even though Venus is nearly twice Mercury's distance from the Sun and thus receives only 25% of Mercury's solar irradiance."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,The surface of Venus is often described as hellish.
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"Although the surface conditions on the planet are no longer hospitable to any Earthlike life that may have formed before this event, it is possible that life exists in the lower and middle cloud layers of Venus."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"The permanent cloud cover means that although Venus is closer than Earth to the Sun, the Venusian surface is not as well lit."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,The surface of Venus is effectively isothermal; it retains a constant temperature not only between day and night but between the equator and the poles.

How big is the planet Venus?,0,Venus's small induced magnetosphere provides negligible protection to the atmosphere against cosmic radiation.
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"The lack of an intrinsic magnetic field at Venus was surprising given it is similar to Earth in size, and was expected also to contain a dynamo at its core."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"On Venus, a global resurfacing event may have shut down plate tectonics and led to a reduced heat flux through the crust."
How big is the planet Venus?,0,"One possibility is that Venus has no solid inner core, or that its core is not cooling, so that the entire liquid part of the core is at approximately the same temperature."

How old is the universe?,0,"The observable matter of the Universe is also spread ""isotropically"", meaning that no direction of observation seems different from any other; each region of the sky has roughly the same content."
How old is the universe?,0,The Universe is also bathed in a highly isotropic microwave radiation that corresponds to a thermal equilibrium blackbody spectrum of roughly 2.725 kelvin.
How old is the universe?,0,"The hypothesis that the large-scale Universe is homogeneous and isotropic is known as the cosmological principle, which is supported by astronomical observations."
How old is the universe?,0,"The present overall density of the Universe is very low, roughly 9.9 × 10−30 grams per cubic centimetre."
How old is the universe?,1,The current estimate of the Universe's age is 13.798 ± 0.037 billion years old.
How old is the universe?,0,"The Universe has not been the same at all times in its history; for example, the relative populations of quasars and galaxies have changed and space itself has expanded."
How old is the universe?,1,"This expansion accounts for how Earth-bound scientists can observe the light from a galaxy 30 billion light years away, even if that light has traveled for only 13 billion years; the very space between them has expanded, and that is one of the tools used to calculate the age of the universe."
How old is the universe?,0,"The relative fractions of different chemical elements — particularly the lightest atoms such as hydrogen, deuterium and helium — seem to be identical throughout the Universe and throughout its observable history."
How old is the universe?,0,"The Universe seems to have much more matter than antimatter, an asymmetry possibly related to the observations of CP violation."
How old is the universe?,0,"The Universe appears to have no net electric charge, and therefore gravity appears to be the dominant interaction on cosmological length scales."
How old is the universe?,0,The Universe also appears to have neither net momentum nor angular momentum.
How old is the universe?,0,"The absence of net charge and momentum would follow from accepted physical laws (Gauss's law and the non-divergence of the stress-energy-momentum pseudotensor, respectively), if the Universe were finite."
How old is the universe?,0,The Universe appears to have a smooth space-time continuum consisting of three spatial dimensions and one temporal (time) dimension.
How old is the universe?,0,"On the average, space is observed to be very nearly flat (close to zero curvature), meaning that Euclidean geometry is experimentally true with high accuracy throughout most of the Universe."
How old is the universe?,0,"Spacetime also appears to have a simply connected topology, at least on the length-scale of the observable Universe."
How old is the universe?,0,"However, present observations cannot exclude the possibilities that the Universe has more dimensions and that its spacetime may have a multiply connected global topology, in analogy with the cylindrical or toroidal topologies of two-dimensional spaces."
How old is the universe?,0,The Universe appears to behave in a manner that regularly follows a set of physical laws and physical constants.
How old is the universe?,0,"The theory of special relativity is believed to hold throughout the Universe, provided that the spatial and temporal length scales are sufficiently short; otherwise, the more general theory of general relativity must be applied."
How old is the universe?,0,"There is no explanation for the particular values that physical constants appear to have throughout our Universe, such as Planck's constant ""h"" or the gravitational constant ""G""."
How old is the universe?,0,It appears that many of the properties of the Universe have special values in the sense that a Universe where these properties differ slightly would not be able to support intelligent life.
How old is the universe?,0,"A relevant observation in this discussion is that for an observer to exist to observe fine-tuning, the Universe must be able to support intelligent life."
How old is the universe?,0,As such the conditional probability of observing a Universe that is fine-tuned to support intelligent life is 1.
How old is the universe?,0,This observation is known as the anthropic principle and is particularly relevant if the creation of the Universe was probabilistic or if multiple universes with a variety of properties exist (see below).
How old is the universe?,1,"However, the observation that the chemistry of life may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago, during a habitable epoch when the Universe was only 10–17 million years old, may differ, in part, with the anthropic principle."
How old is the universe?,0,"The shape or geometry of the Universe includes both local geometry in the observable Universe and global geometry, which we may or may not be able to measure."
How old is the universe?,0,"More formally, the subject in practice investigates which 3-manifold corresponds to the spatial section in comoving coordinates of the four-dimensional space-time of the Universe."
How old is the universe?,0,"If the observable Universe is smaller than the entire Universe (in some models it is many orders of magnitude smaller), one cannot determine the global structure by observation: one is limited to a small patch."
How old is the universe?,0,"Among the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) models, the presently most popular shape of the Universe found to fit observational data according to cosmologists is the infinite flat model, while other FLRW models include the Poincaré dodecahedral space and the Picard horn."
How old is the universe?,0,"Both probes have found almost perfect agreement with inflationary models and the standard model of cosmology, describing a flat, homogeneous universe dominated by dark matter and dark energy."
How old is the universe?,0,"This Greek word refers to celestial spheres, an early Greek model of the Universe."
How old is the universe?,0,"A term for ""Universe"" in ancient Greece was (""tò pán"", The All, Pan (mythology))."
How old is the universe?,0,"Other synonyms for the Universe among the ancient Greek philosophers included (cosmos) and (meaning Nature, from which we derive the word physics)."
How old is the universe?,0,"The same synonyms are found in Latin authors (""totum"", ""mundus"", ""natura"") and survive in modern languages, e.g., the German words ""Das All"", ""Weltall"", and ""Natur"" for Universe."
How old is the universe?,0,"The broadest definition of the Universe is found in ""De divisione naturae"" by the medieval philosopher and theologian Johannes Scotus Eriugena, who defined it as simply everything: everything that is created and everything that is not created."
How old is the universe?,0,"More customarily, the Universe is defined as everything that exists, (has existed, and will exist)."
How old is the universe?,0,"According to our current understanding, the Universe consists of three principles: spacetime, forms of energy, including momentum and matter, and the physical laws that relate them."
How old is the universe?,0,"In principle, the other unconnected universes may have different dimensionalities and topologies of space-time, different forms of matter and energy, and different physical laws and physical constants, although such possibilities are purely speculative."
How old is the universe?,0,"According to a still-more-restrictive definition, the Universe is everything within our connected space-time that could have a chance to interact with us and vice versa."
How old is the universe?,0,"According to the general theory of relativity, some regions of space may never interact with ours even in the lifetime of the Universe due to the finite speed of light and the ongoing expansion of space."
How old is the universe?,0,"Many models of the cosmos (cosmologies) and its origin (cosmogonies) have been proposed, based on the then-available data and conceptions of the Universe."
How old is the universe?,0,Theories of an impersonal Universe governed by physical laws were first proposed by the Greeks and Indians.
How old is the universe?,0,"Over the centuries, improvements in astronomical observations and theories of motion and gravitation led to ever more accurate descriptions of the Universe."
How old is the universe?,0,"The modern era of cosmology began with Albert Einstein's 1915 general theory of relativity, which made it possible to quantitatively predict the origin, evolution, and conclusion of the Universe as a whole."
How old is the universe?,0,"In related stories, the Universe is created by a single entity emanating or producing something by him- or herself, as in the Tibetan Buddhism concept of Adi-Buddha, the ancient Greek story of Gaia (Mother Earth), the Aztec goddess Coatlicue myth, the ancient Egyptian god Atum story, or the Genesis creation narrative."
How old is the universe?,0,"In another type of story, the Universe is created from the union of male and female deities, as in the Maori story of Rangi and Papa."
How old is the universe?,0,"In other stories, the Universe is created by crafting it from pre-existing materials, such as the corpse of a dead god — as from Tiamat in the Babylonian epic ""Enuma Elish"" or from the giant Ymir in Norse mythology – or from chaotic materials, as in Izanagi and Izanami in Japanese mythology."
How old is the universe?,0,"In other stories, the Universe emanates from fundamental principles, such as Brahman and Prakrti, the creation myth of the Serers, or the yin and yang of the Tao."
How old is the universe?,0,The pre-Socratic Greek philosophers and Indian philosophers developed the earliest known philosophical models of the Universe.
How old is the universe?,0,"Democritus, and later philosophers—most notably Leucippus—proposed that the Universe was composed of indivisible atoms moving through void (vacuum)."
How old is the universe?,0,"Astronomical models of the Universe were proposed soon after astronomy began with the Babylonian astronomers, who viewed the Universe as a flat disk floating in the ocean, and this forms the premise for early Greek maps like those of Anaximander and Hecataeus of Miletus."
How old is the universe?,0,"Later Greek philosophers, observing the motions of the heavenly bodies, were concerned with developing models of the Universe based more profoundly on empirical evidence."
How old is the universe?,0,"Other Greek scientists, such as the Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus, postulated that at the center of the Universe was a ""central fire"" around which the Earth, Sun, Moon and Planets revolved in uniform circular motion."
How old is the universe?,0,The Greek astronomer Aristarchus of Samos was the first known individual to propose a heliocentric model of the Universe.
How old is the universe?,0,"But Aristarchus has brought out a book consisting of certain hypotheses, wherein it appears, as a consequence of the assumptions made, that the Universe is many times greater than the 'Universe' just mentioned."
How old is the universe?,0,"During the Middle Ages, heliocentric models were also been proposed by the Indian astronomer Aryabhata, and by the Persian astronomers Albumasar and Al-Sijzi."
How old is the universe?,0,"The Aristotelian model was accepted in the Western world for roughly two millennia, until Copernicus revived Aristarchus' theory that the astronomical data could be explained more plausibly if the earth rotated on its axis and if the sun were placed at the center of the Universe."
How old is the universe?,0,"As noted by Copernicus himself, the suggestion that the Earth rotates was very old, dating at least to Philolaus (c. 450 BC), Heraclides Ponticus (c. 350 BC) and Ecphantus the Pythagorean."
How old is the universe?,0,"One solution to these paradoxes is the Charlier Universe, in which the matter is arranged hierarchically (systems of orbiting bodies that are themselves orbiting in a larger system, ""ad infinitum"") in a fractal way such that the Universe has a negligibly small overall density; such a cosmological model had also been proposed earlier in 1761 by Johann Heinrich Lambert."
How old is the universe?,0,"The modern era of physical cosmology began in 1917, when Albert Einstein first applied his general theory of relativity to model the structure and dynamics of the Universe."
How old is the universe?,0,"Given gravitation's predominance in shaping cosmological structures, accurate predictions of the Universe's past and future require an accurate theory of gravitation."
How old is the universe?,0,General relativity provides a set of ten nonlinear partial differential equations for the spacetime metric (Einstein's field equations) that must be solved from the distribution of mass-energy and momentum throughout the Universe.
How old is the universe?,0,"Because these are unknown in exact detail, cosmological models have been based on the cosmological principle, which states that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic."
How old is the universe?,0,"In effect, this principle asserts that the gravitational effects of the various galaxies making up the Universe are equivalent to those of a fine dust distributed uniformly throughout the Universe with the same average density."
How old is the universe?,0,The assumption of a uniform dust makes it easy to solve Einstein's field equations and predict the past and future of the Universe on cosmological time scales.
How old is the universe?,0,"Depending on its sign, the cosmological constant can either slow (negative ""Λ"") or accelerate (positive ""Λ"") the expansion of the Universe."
How old is the universe?,0,"Although many scientists, including Einstein, had speculated that ""Λ"" was zero, recent astronomical observations of type Ia supernovae have detected a large amount of ""dark energy"" that is accelerating the Universe's expansion."
How old is the universe?,0,The Universe has at least three spatial and one temporal (time) dimension.
How old is the universe?,0,This animation illustrates a closed Friedmann Universe with zero cosmological constant Λ; such a Universe oscillates between a Big Bang and a Big Crunch.
How old is the universe?,0,"However, assuming the cosmological principle that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic everywhere, every point in space is like every other point; hence, the metric tensor must be the same everywhere."
How old is the universe?,0,"In cosmology, solving for the history of the Universe is done by calculating ""R"" as a function of time, given ""k"" and the value of the cosmological constant ""Λ"", which is a (small) parameter in Einstein's field equations."
How old is the universe?,0,"First and most importantly, the length scale ""R"" of the Universe can remain constant ""only"" if the Universe is perfectly isotropic with positive curvature (""k""=1) and has one precise value of density everywhere, as first noted by Albert Einstein."
How old is the universe?,0,"However, this equilibrium is unstable and because the Universe is known to be inhomogeneous on smaller scales, ""R"" must change, according to general relativity."
How old is the universe?,0,"When ""R"" changes, all the spatial distances in the Universe change in tandem; there is an overall expansion or contraction of space itself."
How old is the universe?,0,"Hence, according to Einstein's field equations, ""R"" grew rapidly from an unimaginably hot, dense state that existed immediately following this singularity (when ""R"" had a small, finite value); this is the essence of the Big Bang model of the Universe."
How old is the universe?,0,"If ""k""=1, the curvature is positive and the Universe has a finite volume."
How old is the universe?,0,"Such universes are often visualized as a three-dimensional sphere ""S""3 embedded in a four-dimensional space."
How old is the universe?,0,"Conversely, if ""k"" is zero or negative, the Universe ""may"" have infinite volume, depending on its overall topology."
How old is the universe?,0,"It may seem counter-intuitive that an infinite and yet infinitely dense Universe could be created in a single instant at the Big Bang when ""R""=0, but exactly that is predicted mathematically when ""k"" does not equal 1."
How old is the universe?,0,"A toroidal Universe could behave like a normal Universe with periodic boundary conditions, as seen in ""wrap-around"" video games such as ""Asteroids""; a traveler crossing an outer ""boundary"" of space going ""outwards"" would reappear instantly at another point on the boundary moving ""inwards""."
How old is the universe?,0,"The ultimate fate of the Universe is still unknown, because it depends critically on the curvature index ""k"" and the cosmological constant ""Λ""."
How old is the universe?,0,"If the Universe is sufficiently dense, ""k"" equals +1, meaning that its average curvature throughout is positive and the Universe will eventually recollapse in a Big Crunch, possibly starting a new Universe in a Big Bounce."
How old is the universe?,0,"Conversely, if the Universe is insufficiently dense, ""k"" equals 0 or −1 and the Universe will expand forever, cooling off and eventually becoming inhospitable for all life, as the stars die and all matter coalesces into black holes (the Big Freeze and the heat death of the Universe)."
How old is the universe?,0,"As noted above, recent data suggests that the expansion speed of the Universe is not decreasing as originally expected, but increasing; if this continues indefinitely, the Universe will eventually rip itself to shreds (the Big Rip)."
How old is the universe?,0,"Experimentally, the Universe has an overall density that is very close to the critical value between recollapse and eternal expansion; more careful astronomical observations are needed to resolve the question."
How old is the universe?,0,"As the Universe expands, the energy density of the electromagnetic radiation decreases more quickly than does that of matter, because the energy of a photon decreases with its wavelength."
How old is the universe?,0,"Thus, although the energy density of the Universe is now dominated by matter, it was once dominated by radiation; poetically speaking, all was light."
How old is the universe?,0,"As the Universe expanded, its energy density decreased and it became cooler; as it did so, the elementary particles of matter could associate stably into ever larger combinations."
How old is the universe?,0,"At this stage, the matter in the Universe was mainly a hot, dense plasma of negative electrons, neutral neutrinos and positive nuclei."
How old is the universe?,0,"According to the prevailing theory, a slight imbalance of matter over antimatter was present in the Universe's creation, or developed very shortly thereafter, possibly due to the CP violation that has been observed by particle physicists."
How old is the universe?,0,"Although the matter and antimatter mostly annihilated one another, producing photons, a small residue of matter survived, giving the present matter-dominated Universe."
How old is the universe?,0,Several lines of evidence also suggest that a rapid cosmic inflation of the Universe occurred very early in its history (roughly 10−35 seconds after its creation).
How old is the universe?,0,"Recent observations also suggest that the cosmological constant (""Λ"") is not zero and that the net mass-energy content of the Universe is dominated by a dark energy and dark matter that have not been characterized scientifically."
How old is the universe?,0,"Dark matter gravitates as ordinary matter does, and thus slows the expansion of the Universe; by contrast, dark energy serves to accelerate the Universe's expansion."
How old is the universe?,0,"Some speculative theories have proposed that this Universe is but one of a set of disconnected universes, collectively denoted as the multiverse, challenging or enhancing more limited definitions of the Universe."
How old is the universe?,0,"Scientific multiverse theories are distinct from concepts such as alternate planes of consciousness and simulated reality, although the idea of a larger Universe is not new; for example, Bishop Étienne Tempier of Paris ruled in 1277 that God could create as many universes as he saw fit, a question that was being hotly debated by the French theologians."
How old is the universe?,0,An example of such a theory is the chaotic inflation model of the early Universe.
How old is the universe?,0,"The least controversial category of multiverse in Tegmark's scheme is , which describes distant space-time events ""in our own Universe""."
How old is the universe?,0,"Generally, science would consider a multiverse theory that posits neither a common point of causation, nor the possibility of interaction between universes, to be an idle speculation."
How old is the universe?,0,"The Marvel Universe is the shared fictional universe where stories in most comic book titles and other media published by Marvel Entertainment take place, including those featuring Marvel's most familiar characters, such as Spider-Man, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four and the Avengers."
How old is the universe?,0,"The Marvel Universe is further depicted as existing within a ""multiverse"" consisting of thousands of separate universes, all of which are the creations of Marvel Comics and all of which are, in a sense, ""Marvel universes""."
How old is the universe?,0,"In this context, ""Marvel Universe"" is taken to refer to the mainstream Marvel continuity, which is known as Earth-616."
How old is the universe?,0,"Though the concept of a shared universe was not new or unique to comics in 1960, writer/editor Stan Lee, together with several artists including Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, created a series of titles where events in one book would have repercussions in another title and serialized stories would show characters' growth and change."
How old is the universe?,0,"The Marvel Universe was also notable for setting its central titles in New York City; by contrast, many DC heroes live in fictional cities."
How old is the universe?,0,"Over time, a few Marvel Comics writers lobbied Marvel editors to incorporate the idea of a Multiverse resembling DC's parallel worlds; this plot device allows one to create several fictional universes which normally do not overlap."
How old is the universe?,0,What happens on Earth in the main Marvel Universe would normally have no effect on what happens on a parallel Earth in another Marvel-created universe.
How old is the universe?,0,"However, storywriters would have the creative ability to write stories in which people from one such universe would visit this alternative universe."
How old is the universe?,0,"Each issue contained biographical information on many major costumed characters; these biographies were a precursor to Marvel's series of reference material, ""The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe"", which followed shortly on the heels of ""Contest of Champions""."
How old is the universe?,0,The Marvel Universe is strongly based on the real world.
How old is the universe?,0,"Earth in the Marvel Universe has all the features of the real one: same countries, same personalities (politicians, movie stars, etc.), same historical events (such as the September 11, 2001 attacks), and so on."
How old is the universe?,0,"Most importantly, the Marvel Universe also incorporates examples of almost all major science fiction and fantasy concepts, with writers adding more continuously."
How old is the universe?,0,"Aliens, gods, magic, cosmic powers and extremely advanced human-developed technology all exist prominently in the Marvel Universe."
How old is the universe?,0,"(A universe incorporating ""all"" these types of fantastic elements is fairly rare; another example is the DC Universe.)"
How old is the universe?,0,"Monsters also play a more prominent role with east Asian origins of magical incantation, outlandish sorcery and manifesting principle in the Marvel Universe."
How old is the universe?,0,"Thanks to these extra elements, Earth in the Marvel Universe is home to a large number of superheroes and supervillains, who have gained their powers by any of these means."
How old is the universe?,0,"Comparatively little time passes in the Marvel Universe compared to the real world, owing to the serial nature of storytelling, with the stories of certain issues picking up mere seconds after the conclusion of the previous one, while a whole month has passed by in ""real time""."
How old is the universe?,0,"Marvel's major heroes were created in the 1960s, but the amount of time that has passed between then and now within the universe itself has (after a prolonged period of being identified as about ten years in the mid-to-late 1990s) most recently been identified as thirteen years."
How old is the universe?,0,"Marvel Comics itself exists as a company within the Marvel Universe, and versions of people such as Stan Lee and Jack Kirby have appeared in some of the stories, whereas characters like Steve Rogers, (Captain America's alter ego), have worked for Marvel."

How old is the universe?,0,"Marvel's major heroes are those created between 1961 and 1963, during Marvel's Silver Age: Spider-Man, Iron Man, Doctor Strange, Daredevil, Thor, the Hulk, Ant-Man and the Wasp, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, and S.H.I.E.L.D.’s director, Nick Fury."
How old is the universe?,0,"Unlike the DC Universe, few of Marvel's 1940s characters have become major characters in modern publications; Captain America is one exception, and to a lesser extent his contemporary, the Sub-Mariner, is as well, primarily because both of these characters were reintroduced to readers and to the Marvel Universe during the 1960s."
How old is the universe?,0,"In the Marvel Universe, technology is considerably more advanced than in the real world; this is due to unique individuals of genius intelligence, such as Reed Richards (Mister Fantastic) of the Fantastic Four."
How old is the universe?,0,"Other leftovers from the era where primitive humanoids walked the earth still exist, such as the altered Neanderthal known as Missing Link, an old enemy of the Hulk."

How old is the universe?,0,"Also abundant in the Marvel Universe are legendary creatures such as gods, demons and vampires."
How old is the universe?,0,"Many persons and beings have falsely pretended to be gods or demons during history; in particular, none of the ones claiming to be major figures from Judeo-Christian beliefs has turned out to be the real article, although a number of angels have appeared in recent years, as well as an apparent true rebellion and expulsion of angels from a higher realm known as Paradise, proving that some form of Heaven and Hell do exist in this Universe, seemingly like those in keeping with common real world religious belief."
How old is the universe?,0,"Similarly, demons are evil magical beings who take affairs in the matters of the universe."
How old is the universe?,0,"There are other pantheons that have been depicted in the Marvel Universe that are still actively worshipped in the real world including those worshipped by the Aboriginal inhabitants of Australia, the gods of Hinduism, the Shinto gods and the gods of Zoroastrianism."

How old is the universe?,0,"The Marvel Universe is part of a multiverse, with various universes coexisting simultaneously ""usually"" without affecting each other directly."
How old is the universe?,0,"The concept of a continuity is not the same as ""dimension"" or ""universe""; for example, characters like Mephisto and Dormammu hail from alternative dimensions and Galactus from another universe, but they all nevertheless belong to the Earth-616 continuity (where all the dimensions and universes seems to be connected to the same main timeline)."
How old is the universe?,0,"Despite various contradictions, the term, ""dimension"" is sometimes interchangeable with ""universe"" or ""reality."""
How old is the universe?,0,"Every reality of the Marvel Universe has numerous interconnected dimensions, with each dimension differing from those of other realities; for example, the Ultimate Asgard has clearly been shown to be distinct from the Asgard known to Earth-616 characters."
How old is the universe?,0,"Such dimensions, such as Asgard or the Dark Dimension are technically ""not"" ""pocket dimensions"" as they clearly reside completely ""outside"" the boundaries of the Marvel Universe, instead of within, as the former does."
How old is the universe?,0,"One cannot normally alter the Marvel Universe's history; if a time-traveller should cause an alteration to the established flow of events at some point in the past, a divergent universe will simply ""branch out"" from the existing timeline, and the time-traveller will still return to his or her unaltered original universe."
How old is the universe?,0,"For the most part this does not matter, as most beings are unaware that this occurs, or even that their universes were recently ""born"" from another."
How old is the universe?,0,"It has been shown to be possible to travel through time without creating a new alternative universe, instead altering events in the future, but this seems to have devastating and very far-reaching repercussions, as depicted in Marvel 1602 (it almost destroyed the whole multiverse, including the afterlife)."

How old is the universe?,0,"Although the characters would be portrayed in hundreds and even thousands of adventures over the decades, they have been portrayed as having aged little or none at all."
How old is the universe?,0,"Hence, the passing of time was more discernible in the very early years, such as the graduation of Spider-Man; and what started as children or teenaged characters, such as Kitty Pryde, Franklin Richards, Valeria Richards, Power Pack, or the New Mutants are all allowed to age at wildly shifting rates (in the second case even backwards at times), whereas surrounding characters somewhat dependent on a certain age limit do not change at all."
How old is the universe?,0,"While the Marvel Universe is presumably as large as the non-fictional universe comic book readers inhabit, for all intents and purposes the Local Group is the universe; practically all action takes place in it."
How old is the universe?,0,"The Skrull Empire is located in the Andromeda galaxy, the Kree Empire in the Magellan clouds which are satellites of the Milky Way galaxy in which Earth of course is found, while the Shi´ar Empire is located somewhere between them in one of the smaller galaxies (perhaps Triangulum); frequently, these three empires are quoted as the main political powers ""in the universe""."

Who is the owner of the St. Petersburg Times?,0,"This simplicity of the protocol also permits an application, and a command line interface user, to query a WHOIS server using the Telnet protocol."
Who is the owner of the St. Petersburg Times?,0,"WHOIS lookups were traditionally performed with a command line interface application, but now many alternative web-based tools exist."

Who is the owner of the St. Petersburg Times?,0,"If a WHOIS client did not understand how to deal with this situation, it would display the full information from the registrar."
Who is the owner of the St. Petersburg Times?,0,"Unfortunately, the WHOIS protocol has no standard for determining how to distinguish the thin model from the thick model."
Who is the owner of the St. Petersburg Times?,0,"Some top-level domains, including com and net, operate a thin WHOIS, requiring domain registrars to maintain their own customers' data."

Who is the owner of the St. Petersburg Times?,0,"Lookups of IP address allocations are often limited to the larger Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks (e.g., /24, /22, /16), because usually only the regional Internet registries (RIRs) and domain registrars run RWhois or Whois servers, although RWhois is intended to be run by even smaller local Internet registries, to provided more granular information about IP address assignment."
Who is the owner of the St. Petersburg Times?,0,"RWhois is intended to replace Whois, providing an organized hierarchy of referral services where one could connect to any RWhois server, request a look-up and be automatically re-directed to the correct server(s)."

Who is the owner of the St. Petersburg Times?,0,One large criticism of WHOIS is the lack of domain privacy.
Who is the owner of the St. Petersburg Times?,0,"Currently the ""Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers"" (ICANN) broadly requires that the mailing address, phone number and e-mail address of those owning or administrating a domain name to be made publicly available through the ""WHOIS"" directories."

Who is the owner of the St. Petersburg Times?,0,"In cases where the registrant's (Domain Owner) identity is public, anyone can easily confirm the status of a domain via WHOIS."
Who is the owner of the St. Petersburg Times?,0,"Even if WHOIS data is publicly available, network/registrar companies do not provide any guarantee to the accuracy of information because data which is publicly available is not correct and information need to be verified/authorized by domain registrar(By which domain registration service is provided to registrant) with the same 3 steps mentioned above."
Who is the owner of the St. Petersburg Times?,0,WHOIS has generated policy issues in the United States federal government.

What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"Some 150 years after Alexander (1852) first suggested that the Milky Way was a spiral, there is currently no consensus on the nature of the Milky Way's spiral arms."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"Perfect logarithmic spiral patterns only crudely describe features near the Sun, because galaxies commonly have arms that branch, merge, twist unexpectedly, and feature a degree of irregularity."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"The possible scenario of the Sun within a spur / Local arm emphasizes that point and indicates that such features are probably not unique, and exist elsewhere in the Milky Way."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"As in most spiral galaxies, each spiral arm can be described as a logarithmic spiral."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,There are thought to be four spiral arms that all start near the Milky Way's center.
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"In 2008, Robert Benjamin of the University of Wisconsin–Whitewater used this observation to suggest that the Milky Way possesses only two major stellar arms: the Perseus arm and the Scutum–Centaurus arm."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"In December 2013, astronomers found that the distribution of young stars and star-forming regions matches the four-arm spiral description of the Milky Way."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"Thus, the Milky Way appears to have two spiral arms as traced by old stars and four spiral arms as traced by gas and young stars."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,It was found to be expanding away from the center of the Milky Way at more than 50 km/s.
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,A simulation published in 2011 suggested that the Milky Way may have obtained its spiral arm structure as a result of repeated collisions with the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy.
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"It has been suggested that the Milky Way contains two different spiral patterns: an inner one, formed by the Sagittarius arm, that rotates fast and an outer one, formed by the Carina and Perseus arms, whose rotation velocity is slower and whose arms are tightly wound."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"Outside of the major spiral arms is the Monoceros Ring (or Outer Ring), a ring of gas and stars torn from other galaxies billions of years ago."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"However, several members of the scientific community recently restated their position affirming the Monoceros structure is nothing more than an over-density produced by the flared and warped thick disk of the Milky Way."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"About 40% of the Milky Way's clusters are on retrograde orbits, which means they move in the opposite direction from the Milky Way rotation."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"The globular clusters can follow rosette orbits about the Milky Way, in contrast to the elliptical orbit of a planet around a star."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,Discoveries in the early 21st century have added dimension to the knowledge of the Milky Way's structure.
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,1,"With the discovery that the disk of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) extends much further than previously thought, the possibility of the disk of the Milky Way Galaxy extending further is apparent, and this is supported by evidence from the discovery of the Outer Arm extension of the Cygnus Arm and of a similar extension of the Scutum-Centaurus Arm."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,With the discovery of the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy came the discovery of a ribbon of galactic debris as the polar orbit of the dwarf and its interaction with the Milky Way tears it apart.
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"Similarly, with the discovery of the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy, it was found that a ring of galactic debris from its interaction with the Milky Way encircles the Galactic disk."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"On January 9, 2006, Mario Jurić and others of Princeton University announced that the Sloan Digital Sky Survey of the northern sky found a huge and diffuse structure (spread out across an area around 5,000 times the size of a full moon) within the Milky Way that does not seem to fit within current models."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,The collection of stars rises close to perpendicular to the plane of the spiral arms of the Milky Way.
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,The proposed likely interpretation is that a dwarf galaxy is merging with the Milky Way.
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,This galaxy is tentatively named the Virgo Stellar Stream and is found in the direction of Virgo about 30000 ly away.
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,The mass of this hot halo is nearly equivalent to the mass of the Milky Way itself.
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,Observations of distant galaxies indicate that the Universe had about one-sixth as much baryonic (ordinary) matter as dark matter when it was just a few billion years old.
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"However, only about half of those baryons are accounted for in the modern Universe based on observations of nearby galaxies like the Milky Way."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"If the finding that the mass of the halo is comparable to the mass of the Milky Way is confirmed, it could be the identity of the missing baryons around the Milky Way."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"The apex of the Sun's way, or the solar apex, is the direction that the Sun travels through space in the Milky Way."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,The Sun's orbit about the Milky Way is expected to be roughly elliptical with the addition of perturbations due to the Galactic spiral arms and non-uniform mass distributions.
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"It takes the Solar System about 240 million years to complete one orbit of the Milky Way (a ""Galactic year""), so the Sun is thought to have completed 18–20 orbits during its lifetime and 1/1250 of a revolution since the origin of humans."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,The orbital speed of the Solar System about the center of the Milky Way is approximately 220 km/s or 0.073% of the speed of light.
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"The stars and gas in the Milky Way rotate about its center differentially, meaning that the rotation period varies with location."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"As is typical for spiral galaxies, the orbital speed of most stars in the Milky Way does not depend strongly on their distance from the center."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"Toward the center of the Milky Way the orbit speeds are too low, whereas beyond 7 kpcs the speeds are too high to match what would be expected from the universal law of gravitation."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"If the Milky Way contained only the mass observed in stars, gas, and other baryonic (ordinary) matter, the rotation speed would decrease with distance from the center."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"The rotation curve of the Milky Way agrees with the universal rotation curve of spiral galaxies, the strongest proof of the existence of dark matter in galaxies."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,The Milky Way began as one or several small overdensities in the mass distribution in the Universe shortly after the Big Bang.
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,Some of these overdensities were the seeds of globular clusters in which the oldest remaining stars in what is now the Milky Way formed.
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,These stars and clusters now comprise the stellar halo of the Milky Way.
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"Within a few billion years of the birth of the first stars, the mass of the Milky Way was large enough so that it was spinning relatively quickly."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"Since the first stars began to form, the Milky Way has grown through both galaxy mergers (particularly early in the Milky Way's growth) and accretion of gas directly from the Galactic halo."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"The Milky Way is currently accreting material from two of its nearest satellite galaxies, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, through the Magellanic Stream."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"However, properties of the Milky Way such as stellar mass, angular momentum, and metallicity in its outermost regions suggest it has undergone no mergers with large galaxies in the last 10 billion years."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,1,This lack of recent major mergers is unusual among similar spiral galaxies; its neighbour the Andromeda Galaxy appears to have a more typical history shaped by more recent mergers with relatively large galaxies.
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,1,"According to recent studies, the Milky Way as well as Andromeda lie in what in the galaxy color–magnitude diagram is known as the ""green valley"", a region populated by galaxies in transition from the ""blue cloud"" (galaxies actively forming new stars) to the ""red sequence"" (galaxies that lack star formation)."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,Star-formation activity in green valley galaxies is slowing as they run out of star-forming gas in the interstellar medium.
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,1,"In simulated galaxies with similar properties, star formation will typically have been extinguished within about five billion years from now, even accounting for the expected, short-term increase in the rate of star formation due to the collision between both the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"In fact, measurements of other galaxies similar to the Milky Way suggest it is among the reddest and brightest spiral galaxies that are still forming new stars and it is just slightly bluer than the bluest red sequence galaxies."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"The ages of individual stars in the Milky Way can be estimated by measuring the abundance of long-lived radioactive elements such as thorium-232 and uranium-238, then comparing the results to estimates of their original abundance, a technique called nucleocosmochronology."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"Globular clusters are among the oldest objects in the Milky Way Galaxy, which thus set a lower limit on the age of the Milky Way."

What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"There may still be undetected dwarf galaxies that are dynamically bound to the Milky Way, as well as some that have already been absorbed by the Milky Way, such as Omega Centauri."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"In January 2006, researchers reported that the heretofore unexplained warp in the disk of the Milky Way has now been mapped and found to be a ripple or vibration set up by the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds as they orbit the Milky Way, causing vibrations when they pass through its edges."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"Previously, these two galaxies, at around 2% of the mass of the Milky Way, were considered too small to influence the Milky Way."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"However, in a computer model, the movement of these two galaxies creates a dark matter wake that amplifies their influence on the larger Milky Way."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,1,Current measurements suggest the Andromeda Galaxy is approaching us at 100 to 140 kilometers per second.
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,1,"In 3 to 4 billion years, there may be an Andromeda–Milky Way collision, depending on the importance of unknown lateral components to the galaxies' relative motion."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"If they collide, the chance of individual stars colliding with each other is extremely low, but instead the two galaxies will merge to form a single elliptical galaxy or perhaps a large disk galaxy over the course of about a billion years."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"Although special relativity states that there is no ""preferred"" inertial frame of reference in space with which to compare the Milky Way, the Milky Way does have a velocity with respect to cosmological frames of reference."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"One such frame of reference is the Hubble flow, the apparent motions of galaxy clusters due to the expansion of space."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"Individual galaxies, including the Milky Way, have peculiar velocities relative to the average flow."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"Thus, to compare the Milky Way to the Hubble flow, one must consider a volume large enough so that the expansion of the Universe dominates over local, random motions."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,A large enough volume means that the mean motion of galaxies within this volume is equal to the Hubble flow.
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,Astronomers believe the Milky Way is moving at approximately 630 km per second with respect to this local co-moving frame of reference.
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"The Milky Way is moving in the general direction of the Great Attractor and other galaxy clusters, including the Shapley supercluster, behind it."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,1,"The Local Group (a cluster of gravitationally bound galaxies containing, among others, the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy) is part of a supercluster called the Local Supercluster, centered near the Virgo Cluster: although they are moving away from each other at 967 km/s as part of the Hubble flow, this velocity is less than would be expected given the 16.8 million pc distance due to the gravitational attraction between the Local Group and the Virgo Cluster."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"The Milky Way is moving at with respect to the photons of the CMB, toward 10.5 right ascension, −24° declination (J2000 epoch, near the center of Hydra)."

What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"In ""Meteorologica"" (DK 59 A80), Aristotle (384–322 BC) wrote that the Greek philosophers Anaxagoras (ca. 500–428 BC) and Democritus (460–370 BC) proposed that the Milky Way might consist of distant stars."
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"However, Aristotle himself believed the Milky Way to be caused by ""the ignition of the fiery exhalation of some stars which were large, numerous and close together"" and that the ""ignition takes place in the upper part of the atmosphere, in the region of the world which is continuous with the heavenly motions."""
What galaxy is closest to the milky way?,0,"The Neoplatonist philosopher Olympiodorus the Younger (c. 495–570 A.D.) criticized this view, arguing that if the Milky Way were sublunary it should appear different at different times and places on Earth, and that it should have parallax, which it does not."

What does HTML stand for?,0,"The browser does not display the HTML tags and scripts, but uses them to interpret the content of the page."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"HTML describes the structure of a Website semantically along with cues for presentation, making it a markup language, rather than a programming language."
What does HTML stand for?,0,HTML elements form the building blocks of all Websites.
What does HTML stand for?,0,HTML allows images and objects to be embedded and can be used to create interactive forms.
What does HTML stand for?,0,It can embed scripts written in languages such as JavaScript which affect the behavior of HTML Web pages.
What does HTML stand for?,0,"The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, encourages the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML."
What does HTML stand for?,0,Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990.
What does HTML stand for?,0,"The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called ""HTML Tags"", first mentioned on the Internet by Berners-Lee in late 1991."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML."
What does HTML stand for?,0,Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.
What does HTML stand for?,0,"Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with also the separation of structure and markup; HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS."
What does HTML stand for?,0,Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML.
What does HTML stand for?,1,"It was formally defined as such by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification: ""Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)"" Internet-Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which included an SGML Document Type Definition to define the grammar."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Internet-Draft, ""HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)"", from late 1993, suggested standardizing already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working Group, which in 1995 completed ""HTML 2.0"", the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a standard against which future implementations should be based."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"Since 1996, the HTML specifications have been maintained, with input from commercial software vendors, by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"However, in 2000, HTML also became an international standard (ISO/IEC 15445:2000)."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999, with further errata published through 2001."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"In 2004 development began on HTML5 in the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which became a joint deliverable with the W3C in 2008, and completed and standardized on 28 October 2014."
What does HTML stand for?,0,XHTML is a separate language that began as a reformulation of HTML 4.01 using XML 1.0.
What does HTML stand for?,0,"HTML markup consists of several key components, including ""tags"" (and their ""attributes""), character-based ""data types"", ""character references"" and ""entity references""."
What does HTML stand for?,0,This Document Type Declaration is for HTML5.
What does HTML stand for?,0,HTML documents imply a structure of nested HTML elements.
What does HTML stand for?,0,An HTML browser or other agent can infer the closure for the end of an element from the context and the structural rules defined by the HTML standard.
What does HTML stand for?,0,These rules are complex and not widely understood by most HTML coders.
What does HTML stand for?,0,"Some HTML elements are defined as ""empty elements"" and take the form codice_5."
What does HTML stand for?,0,The name of an HTML element is the name used in the tags.
What does HTML stand for?,0,This is a link in HTML.
What does HTML stand for?,0,"The value may be enclosed in single or double quotes, although values consisting of certain characters can be left unquoted in HTML (but not XHTML) ."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"As of version 4.0, HTML defines a set of 252 character entity references and a set of 1,114,050 numeric character references, both of which allow individual characters to be written via simple markup, rather than literally."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"Equivalently, the single-quote character (codice_36), when not used to quote an attribute value, must also be escaped as codice_37 or codice_38 (or as codice_39 in HTML5 or XHTML documents ) when it appears within the attribute value itself."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"For example, the acute-accented codice_40 (codice_41), a character typically found only on Western European and South American keyboards, can be written in any HTML document as the entity reference codice_42 or as the numeric references codice_43 or codice_44, using characters that are available on all keyboards and are supported in all character encodings."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"HTML defines several data types for element content, such as script data and stylesheet data, and a plethora of types for attribute values, including IDs, names, URIs, numbers, units of length, languages, media descriptors, colors, character encodings, dates and times, and so on."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"HTML documents are required to start with a Document Type Declaration (informally, a ""doctype"")."
What does HTML stand for?,0,The original purpose of the doctype was to enable parsing and validation of HTML documents by SGML tools based on the Document Type Definition (DTD).
What does HTML stand for?,0,"Browsers, on the other hand, do not implement HTML as an application of SGML and by consequence do not read the DTD."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"In addition, HTML 4.01 provides Transitional and Frameset DTDs, as explained below."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"HTML has included semantic markup from its inception, but has also included presentational markup, such as codice_45, codice_45 and codice_45 tags."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"Since the late 1990s when Cascading Style Sheets were beginning to work in most browsers, web authors have been encouraged to avoid the use of presentational HTML markup with a view to the separation of presentation and content."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"In order for search-engine spiders to be able to rate the significance of pieces of text they find in HTML documents, and also for those creating mashups and other hybrids as well as for more automated agents as they are developed, the semantic structures that exist in HTML need to be widely and uniformly applied to bring out the meaning of published text."
What does HTML stand for?,0,Presentational markup tags are deprecated in current HTML and XHTML recommendations and are illegal in HTML5.
What does HTML stand for?,0,Good semantic HTML also improves the accessibility of web documents (see also Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).
What does HTML stand for?,0,HTML documents can be delivered by the same means as any other computer file.
What does HTML stand for?,0,The World Wide Web is composed primarily of HTML documents transmitted from web servers to web browsers using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
What does HTML stand for?,0,"However, HTTP is used to serve images, sound, and other content, in addition to HTML."
What does HTML stand for?,0,This meta data usually includes the MIME type (e.g. text/html or application/xhtml+xml) and the character encoding (see Character encoding in HTML).
What does HTML stand for?,0,"In modern browsers, the MIME type that is sent with the HTML document may affect how the document is initially interpreted."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"The same document sent with the HTML MIME type might be displayed successfully, since some browsers are more lenient with HTML."
What does HTML stand for?,0,Most graphical email clients allow the use of a subset of HTML (often ill-defined) to provide formatting and semantic markup not available with plain text.
What does HTML stand for?,0,Many such clients include both a GUI editor for composing HTML e-mail messages and a rendering engine for displaying them.
What does HTML stand for?,0,"Use of HTML in e-mail is controversial because of compatibility issues, because it can help disguise phishing attacks, because of accessibility issues for blind or visually impaired people, because it can confuse spam filters and because the message size is larger than plain text."
What does HTML stand for?,0,The most common filename extension for files containing HTML is .
What does HTML stand for?,0,html.
What does HTML stand for?,0,"An HTML Application (HTA; file extension ""."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"hta"") is a Microsoft Windows application that uses HTML and Dynamic HTML in a browser to provide the application's graphical interface."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"A regular HTML file is confined to the security model of the web browser's security, communicating only to web servers and manipulating only webpage objects and site cookies."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"Since its inception, HTML and its associated protocols gained acceptance relatively quickly."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"Though its creators originally conceived of HTML as a semantic language devoid of presentation details, practical uses pushed many presentational elements and attributes into the language, driven largely by the various browser vendors."
What does HTML stand for?,0,The latest standards surrounding HTML reflect efforts to overcome the sometimes chaotic development of the language and to create a rational foundation for building both meaningful and well-presented documents.
What does HTML stand for?,0,"To return HTML to its role as a semantic language, the W3C has developed style languages such as CSS and XSL to shoulder the burden of presentation."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"In conjunction, the HTML specification has slowly reined in the presentational elements."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"There are two axes differentiating various variations of HTML as currently specified: SGML-based HTML versus XML-based HTML (referred to as XHTML) on one axis, and strict versus transitional (loose) versus frameset on the other axis."
What does HTML stand for?,0,One difference in the latest HTML specifications lies in the distinction between the SGML-based specification and the XML-based specification.
What does HTML stand for?,0,"However, the root element name continues to be ""html"" even in the XHTML-specified HTML."
What does HTML stand for?,0,The W3C intended XHTML 1.0 to be identical to HTML 4.01 except where limitations of XML over the more complex SGML require workarounds.
What does HTML stand for?,0,"Because XHTML and HTML are closely related, they are sometimes documented in parallel."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"In such circumstances, some authors conflate the two names as (X)HTML or X(HTML)."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"Like HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.0 has three sub-specifications: strict, transitional and frameset."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"Aside from the different opening declarations for a document, the differences between an HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 document—in each of the corresponding DTDs—are largely syntactic."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"The underlying syntax of HTML allows many shortcuts that XHTML does not, such as elements with optional opening or closing tags, and even empty elements which must not have an end tag."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"The introduction of this shorthand, which is not used in the SGML declaration for HTML 4.01, may confuse earlier software unfamiliar with this new convention."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"To understand the subtle differences between HTML and XHTML, consider the transformation of a valid and well-formed XHTML 1.0 document that adheres to Appendix C (see below) into a valid HTML 4.01 document."
What does HTML stand for?,0,To translate from HTML to XHTML would also require the addition of any omitted opening or closing tags.
What does HTML stand for?,0,Whether coding in HTML or XHTML it may just be best to always include the optional tags within an HTML document rather than remembering which tags can be omitted.
What does HTML stand for?,0,The W3C recommends several conventions to ensure an easy migration between HTML and XHTML (see HTML Compatibility Guidelines).
What does HTML stand for?,0,"For documents that are XHTML 1.0 and have been made compatible in this way, the W3C permits them to be served either as HTML (with a codice_54 MIME type), or as XHTML (with an codice_66 or codice_67 MIME type)."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"HTML 4 defined three different versions of the language: Strict, Transitional (once called Loose) and Frameset."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"The Strict version is intended for new documents and is considered best practice, while the Transitional and Frameset versions were developed to make it easier to transition documents that conformed to older HTML specification or didn't conform to any specification to a version of HTML 4."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"Instead, cascading style sheets are encouraged to improve the presentation of HTML documents."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"Because XHTML 1 only defines an XML syntax for the language defined by HTML 4, the same differences apply to XHTML 1 as well."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"In addition to the above transitional differences, the frameset specifications (whether XHTML 1.0 or HTML 4.01) specifies a different content model, with codice_149 replacing codice_68, that contains either codice_151 elements, or optionally codice_72 with a codice_68."
What does HTML stand for?,0,Rather the X in XML stands for extensible and the W3C is modularizing the entire specification and opening it up to independent extensions.
What does HTML stand for?,0,The strict version of HTML is deployed in XHTML 1.1 through a set of modular extensions to the base XHTML 1.1 specification.
What does HTML stand for?,0,"So for example, XHTML 1.1 will allow quicker migration to emerging XML standards such as MathML (a presentational and semantic math language based on XML) and XForms—a new highly advanced web-form technology to replace the existing HTML forms."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"In summary, the HTML 4 specification primarily reined in all the various HTML implementations into a single clearly written specification based on SGML."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"The WhatWG considers their work as ""living standard"" HTML for what constitutes the state of the art in major browser implementations by Apple (Safari), Google (Chrome), Mozilla (Firefox), Opera (Opera), and others."
What does HTML stand for?,0,HTML5 is specified by the HTML Working Group of the W3C following the W3C process.
What does HTML stand for?,0,"both specifications are similar and mostly derived from each other, i.e., the work on HTML5 started with an older WhatWG draft, and later the WhatWG ""living standard"" was based on HTML5 drafts in 2011."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"HTML lacks some of the features found in earlier hypertext systems, such as source tracking, fat links and others."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"Even some hypertext features that were in early versions of HTML have been ignored by most popular web browsers until recently, such as the link element and in-browser Web page editing."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"There are some WYSIWYG editors (What You See Is What You Get), in which the user lays out everything as it is to appear in the HTML document using a graphical user interface (GUI), often similar to word processors."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"The editor renders the document rather than show the code, so authors do not require extensive knowledge of HTML."
What does HTML stand for?,0,JHTML stands for Java within HTML.
What does HTML stand for?,0,"jhtml"" filename extension contain standard HTML tags in addition to proprietary tags that reference Java objects running on a special server set up to handle requests for pages of this sort."
What does HTML stand for?,0,"class file as a servlet whose sole function is to emit a stream of standard HTTP and HTML data back to the HTTP server and on back to the client software (the web browser, usually) that originally requested the document."
What does HTML stand for?,0,The principal benefit of this system is that it allows logic running in Java on the application server to generate the HTML dynamically.
What does HTML stand for?,0,The system is derived from earlier forms of CGI programming that allow a program running on a web server to generate HTML dynamically.
What does HTML stand for?,0,"With JHTML, you can author standard HTML and just insert a few extra tags that represent the pieces of the HTML page data that Java should be used to create."

What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"He was an assistant coach for the Los Angeles Lakers under Pat Riley and Mike Dunleavy, and was the team's head coach during the 1992–93 and 1993–94 seasons, although he was let go near the end of his second season, being replaced for the remainder of the year by Magic Johnson."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"Pfund played college basketball at Wheaton College, where he amassed a cumulative scoring average of well over double figures, averaging nearly 25 points per game in his senior season."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"Goto (goto, GOTO, GO TO or other case combinations, depending on the programming language) is a statement found in many computer programming languages."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"At the machine code level, a goto is a form of branch or jump statement."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"Many languages support the goto statement, and many do not (see language support)."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"The structured program theorem proved that the goto statement is not necessary to write programs; some combination of the three programming constructs of sequence, selection/choice, and repetition/iteration are sufficient for any computation that can be performed by a Turing machine, with the caveat that code duplication and additional variables may need to be introduced."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"At machine code level, goto is used to implement the structured programming constructs."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,In the past there was considerable debate in academia and industry on the merits of the use of goto statements.
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"Use of goto was formerly common, but since the advent of structured programming in the 1960s and 1970s its use has declined significantly."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,The primary criticism is that code that uses goto statements is harder to understand than alternative constructions.
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"Goto remains in use in certain common usage patterns, but alternatives are generally used if available."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"Although at the pre-ALGOL meeting held in 1959, Heinz Zemanek explicitly threw doubts on the necessity of GOTO statements, at the time no one paid attention to his remark, including Edsger Dijkstra, who would later become the iconic opponent of GOTO."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"The 1970s and 1980s saw a decline in the use of GOTO statements in favor of the ""structured programming"" paradigm, with goto criticized as leading to ""unmaintainable spaghetti code"" (see below)."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"Some programming style coding standards, for example the Gnu Pascal Coding Standards, recommend against the use of GOTO statements."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"It has, however, sparked a prominent debate among computer scientists, educators, language designers and application programmers that saw a slow but steady shift away from the formerly ubiquitous use of the GOTO."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"Probably the most famous criticism of GOTO is a 1968 letter by Edsger Dijkstra called ""Go To Statement Considered Harmful""."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,In that letter Dijkstra argued that unrestricted GOTO statements should be abolished from higher-level languages because they complicated the task of analyzing and verifying the correctness of programs (particularly those involving loops).
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"The letter itself sparked a debate, including a ""'GOTO Considered Harmful' Considered Harmful"" letter sent to ""Communications of the ACM"" (CACM) in March 1987, as well as further replies by other people, including Dijkstra's ""On a Somewhat Disappointing Correspondence""."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"An alternative viewpoint is presented in Donald Knuth's ""Structured Programming with go to Statements"", which analyzes many common programming tasks and finds that in some of them GOTO is the optimal language construct to use."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"Other programmers, such as Linux Kernel designer and coder Linus Torvalds or software engineer and book author Steve McConnell, also object to Dijkstra's point of view, stating that GOTOs can be a useful language feature, improving program speed, size and code clearness, but only when used in a sensible way by a comparably sensible programmer."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"According to computer science professor John Regehr, in 2013, there were about 100,000 instances of goto in the Linux kernel code."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"Fortran introduced structured programming constructs in 1978 and in successive revisions the relatively loose semantic rules governing the allowable use of goto were tightened; the ""extended range"" in which a programmer could use a GOTO to enter and leave a still-executing DO loop was removed from the language in 1978, and by 1995 several forms of Fortran GOTO, including the Computed GOTO and the Assigned GOTO, had been deleted from the language."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"Some widely used modern programming languages, such as Java and Python lack the GOTO statement – see language support – though most provide some means of breaking out of a selection, or either breaking out of or moving on to the next step of an iteration."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"However, throwing and catching an exception inside a function can be extraordinarily inefficient in some languages; a prime example is Objective-C, where a goto is a much faster alternative."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"Another use of goto statements is to modify poorly-factored legacy code, where avoiding a goto would require extensive refactoring or code duplication."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"For example, given a large function where only certain code is of interest, a goto statement allows one to jump to or from only the relevant code, without otherwise modifying the function."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"Although these three control structures can all be hand-coded using codice_1s and codice_17s, the desire for clarity and efficient optimization led to the introduction and refinement of supporting structures such as (in Pascal) procedure and function blocks, codice_18, codice_19, and codice_20 statements, and codice_21 statements (a form of multiway branching, replacing computed goto)."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"The throw-catch exception handling mechanisms can also be easily abused to create non-transparent control structures, just like goto can be abused."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"In a paper delivered to the ACM conference in Seattle in 1977, Guy L. Steele summarized the debate over the GOTO and structured programming, and observed that procedure calls in the tail position of a procedure can be most optimally treated as a direct transfer of control to the called procedure, typically eliminating unnecessary stack manipulation operations."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"Since such ""tail calls"" are very common in Lisp, a language where procedure calls are ubiquitous, this form of optimization considerably reduces the cost of a procedure call compared to the GOTO used in other languages."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,Steele argued that poorly implemented procedure calls had led to an artificial perception that the GOTO was cheap compared to the procedure call.
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"Steele further argued that ""in general procedure calls may be usefully thought of as GOTO statements which also pass parameters, and can be uniformly coded as machine code JUMP instructions"", with the machine code stack manipulation instructions ""considered an optimization (rather than vice versa!)"""
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"Further, tail call optimization allows mutual recursion of unbounded depth, assuming tail calls – this allows transfer of control, as in finite state machines, which otherwise is generally accomplished with goto statements."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"Coroutines are a more radical relaxation of structured programming, allowing not only multiple exit points (as in returns in non-tail position), but also multiple entry points, similar to goto statements."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"Coroutines are more restricted than goto, as they can only ""resume"" a currently-running coroutine at specified points – continuing after a yield – rather than jumping to an arbitrary point in the code."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"A combination of state variables and structured control, notably an overall switch statement, can allow a subroutine to resume execution at an arbitrary point on subsequent calls, and is a structured alternative to goto statements in the absence of coroutines; this is a common idiom in C, for example."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,A continuation is similar to a GOTO in that it transfers control from an arbitrary point in the program to a previously marked point.
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"A continuation is more flexible than GOTO in those languages that support it, because it can transfer control out of the current function, something that a GOTO cannot do in most structured programming languages."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"In non-procedural paradigms, goto is less relevant or completely absent."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"There are a number of different language constructs under the class of ""goto"" statements."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,Fortran also had an assigned goto variant that transfers control to a statement label (line number) which is stored in (assigned to) an integer variable.
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"Jumping to an integer variable that had not been ASSIGNEd to was unfortunately possible, and was a major source of bugs involving assigned gotos."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,The goto instruction is also extended to allow jumping to an arbitrary codice_33 expression.
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"This C extension is referred to as a ""computed goto"" in documentation of the C compilers that support it; its semantics are a superset of Fortran's assigned goto, because it allows arbitrary pointer expressions as the goto target, while Fortran's assigned goto doesn't allow arbitrary expressions as jump target."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"As with the standard goto in C, the GNU C extension allows the target of the computed goto to reside only in the current function."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"Some variants of BASIC also support a computed GOTO in the sense used in GNU C, i.e. in which the target can be ""any"" line number, not just one from a list."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"Up to the 1985 ANSI COBOL standard had the ALTER verb which could be used to change the destination of an existing GO TO, which had to be in a paragraph by itself."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"In Perl, there is a variant of the codice_1 statement that is not a traditional GOTO statement at all."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"It takes a function name and transfers control by effectively substituting one function call for another (a tail call): the new function will not return to the GOTO, but instead to the place from which the original function was called."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,There are several programming languages that do not support GOTO by default.
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"By using GOTO emulation, it is still possible to use GOTO in these programming languages, albeit with some restrictions."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"One can emulate GOTO in Java, JavaScript, and Python."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"PL/I has the data type ""LABEL"", which can be used to implement both the ""assigned goto"" and the ""computed goto."""
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"Many languages support the goto statement, and many do not."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"In Java, goto is a reserved word, but is unusable, although the compiled file.class generates GOTOs and LABELs."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"Python does not have support for goto, other than in the joke module goto."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,In PHP there was no native support for goto until version 5.3 (libraries were available to emulate its functionality).
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"C has goto, and it is commonly used in various idioms, as discussed above."
What college did Magic Johnson go to?,0,"Functional programming languages such as Scheme generally do not have goto, instead using continuations."

What is the density of gold?,0,Population density (in agriculture : standing stock and standing crop) is a measurement of population per unit area or unit volume; it is a quantity of type number density.
What is the density of gold?,0,"""Lists of population density of different countries are below."
What is the density of gold?,0,"Lists of other population densities are in See also section."""
What is the density of gold?,0,"Population density is population divided by total land area or water volume, as appropriate."
What is the density of gold?,0,Low densities may cause an extinction vortex and lead to further reduced fertility.
What is the density of gold?,0,Therefore the worldwide human population density is around 7 billion ÷ 510 million = 13.7 per km2 (35 per sq. mile).
What is the density of gold?,0,"If only the Earth's land area of 150 million km2 (58 million sq. miles) is taken into account, then human population density increases to 47 per km2 (120 per sq. mile)."
What is the density of gold?,0,"If Antarctica is also excluded, then population density rises to over 50 people per km2 (over 130 per sq. mile)."

What is the density of gold?,0,"Cities with high population densities are, by some, considered to be overpopulated, though this will depend on factors like quality of housing and infrastructure and access to resources."
What is the density of gold?,0,"City population and especially area are, however, heavily dependent on the definition of ""urban area"" used: densities are amost invariably higher for the central city area than when suburban settlements and the intervening rural areas are included, as in the areas of agglomeration or metropolitan area, the latter including sometimes neighboring cities."
What is the density of gold?,0,"For instance, Milwaukee has a greater population density when just the inner city is measured, and the surrounding suburbs excluded."
What is the density of gold?,0,"While arithmetic density is the most common way of measuring population density, several other methods have been developed which aim to provide a more accurate measure of population density over a specific area."
What is the density of gold?,0,"The density, or more precisely, the volumetric mass density, of a substance is its mass per unit volume."

What is the density of gold?,0,"Different materials usually have different densities, and density may be relevant to buoyancy, purity and packaging."
What is the density of gold?,0,"To simplify comparisons of density across different systems of units, it is sometimes replaced by the dimensionless quantity ""relative density"" or ""specific gravity"", i.e. the ratio of the density of the material to that of a standard material, usually water."
What is the density of gold?,0,Thus a relative density less than one means that the substance floats in water.
What is the density of gold?,0,The density of a material varies with temperature and pressure.
What is the density of gold?,0,Increasing the pressure on an object decreases the volume of the object and thus increases its density.
What is the density of gold?,0,Increasing the temperature of a substance (with a few exceptions) decreases its density by increasing its volume.
What is the density of gold?,0,"In most materials, heating the bottom of a fluid results in convection of the heat from the bottom to the top, due to the decrease in the density of the heated fluid."
